# Flexo NEXT prototype

Flexo CMS is great project that is outdated and currently not supported.

So I decide that need a platform with following features:
- Composer packages
- Very extensionable
- Have light core
- Have basic UI that can be extended
- Have templates engine
- Written with PHP 7+

That is experiment that trying to provide all above features.

Name 'Flexo NEXT' is choosen because I have a big experiance with Flexo/Frog CMS
that both is a great CMS, but both is just CMS, I need a platform that provide
a modules/extensions/plugins that linked together via composer, and you can build
your own CMS/CMF or any type of project that you need. Also platform is not just
a source, it is a source plus community plus infrastructure. For now current
project is just a source, and I need work hard to provide other two ingredients.

Thanks for watching. :)
